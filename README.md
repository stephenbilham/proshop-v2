FEW THINGS!!

You are more than welcome to make an account but to check out the admin functionality and to see a lot of the features of the app you need to sign in as:
admin@email.com
pw: 123456

as well if you want to get passed the checkout screen you need my FAKE paypal
paypal account name: sb-efyvy29624804@personal.example.com
pw: Zwj/X.3R

Within this application there are two users - non admin and admin each with different UI screens.
- The admin account can edit, add, delete products (image upload too) from the website as well as user accounts, and update delivery status on orders.
- Both accounts have their own profile where they can update their user name and profile and see their own order history
- Users can make product reviews
- Page pagination (if enough products)
- I've integrated payment options through the Paypal payment API

Take a look there is much more! This is all open source on my github account https://lnkd.in/gSZTc7PN
